nHouseMSG = "You are facing the north side of a white house. There is no door here, and all the windows are boarded up. To the north a narrow path winds through the trees."

treeMSG = """You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The
nearest branch above you is above your reach.
Beside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.
In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently
scavanged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, 
and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one
is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp. The egg appears extremely
fragile."""

kitchenMSG = """You are in the kitchen of the house. A table seems to have been used recently for the preperation of food.

leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mark the
walls."""
